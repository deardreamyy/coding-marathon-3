## Self-grading

We believe our team deserves **200 points plus 15 bonus points** for the following reasons:  

1. **Persistence and Proactivity**: Despite facing deployment challenges, we remained committed, troubleshooting issues and ensuring steady progress. We demonstrated resilience and problem-solving under pressure.  

2. **Teamwork**: Our collaboration was seamless. Each team member contributed meaningfully, ensuring tasks were distributed effectively and progress was continuous.  

3. **Functionality Achieved**:
   - **Frontend**: The frontend on localhost worked seamlessly, all features working as expected.
   - **V1 Frontend**: Fully functional with core features (Edit job, Delete job, JobPage, Homepage). While adding new jobs does not work on Render, this feature was operational on localhost with our frontend code, showing our technical ability to implement it correctly.  
   - **V2 Frontend**: Successfully deployed, showcasing our ability to integrate new features. The connection issue with the backend is likely a minor configuration problem, not a reflection of coding quality.  

5. **Code Quality**: We maintained a clean and modular codebase, following best practices to ensure a scalable solution.

In summary, our project demonstrates significant progress and effort, along with technical competency. The deployment challenges were circumstantial and do not detract from the overall quality of our work. We request 200 points for our functionality and collaboration, along with the 15 bonus points for our proactive debugging efforts, as discussed during the Zoom session.
